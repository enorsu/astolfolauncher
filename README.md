# astolfolauncher(unofficial)
open-source launcher for (cracked) astolfo

It uses a slightly modified version of the launch code

Keep in mind that the jar file IS RAT, also only tested with AllahLeaks's files

It will *PROBABLY* NOT work with anything else

This ask you to install a program that DISABLES the RAT

DM/PM me on discord for information

My username is "Enorsu" (dc)

The launcher was coded in python using CustomTkinter

you can run the launcher without the astolfo files, but you cant launch anything with it

# How to use
Only tested on Windows 10 with Zulu 8

You need to have official Minecraft Launcher installed for the astolfo client to run


# Without Python(on windows)
Download the launcher.exe from releases and place it with release.jar in the astolfo files

Then run launcher.exe and the launcher should start


# With Python 3(on windows)
Download launcher.py from releases and place it with release.jar in the astolfo files.

There are no special Python requirements just run it with python3.
