# astolfolauncher(unofficial)
open-source launcher for (cracked) astolfo.

it uses the original launch code in a nice gui.

keep in mind this has been only tested with a specific set of files from "allahleaks".

it will not work with anything else.

and the official link is gone.

you need to dm me in discord for more info.

my username is in the launcher's credits.

the launcher is built with plain python and tkinter.

you can run the launcher without the astolfo files, but you cant launch anything with it.

# How to use
Only tested on Windows 10 with Zulu 8
You need to have official Minecraft Launcher installed for the astolfo client to run


# Without Python(on windows)
Download the launcher.exe from releases and place it with release.jar in the astolfo files.

Then run launcher.exe and the launcher should start.


# With Python 3(on windows)
Download launcher.py from releases and place it with release.jar in the astolfo files.

There are no special Python requirements just run it with python3.
